# SpaceNugget
A simple mouse-controlled game, written in Haskell. 

Long time ago, in a galaxy far far away is a fatboi, whose goal is to get fatter by eating nuggets scattered in a star-field. There's just one problem- we live in a ~~society~~ meteor shower. The goal is simple: dodge the meteors and eat the nuggets.

## Gameplay

The snake follows your mouse pointer, that's about it really. Number keys change the colour, so style the fatboi as you like!
